Use [appear.in](https://appear.in/) just like you do in your browser, but as a desktop app. This app will also notify you in its icon when messages are received.

## This is an unofficial app

The appear.in team has been gracious enough to [allow me to use their name and logo on this app](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/appear.in/pull/1), but it is still unofficial. I will retire this app if an official one is ever released.

If you find any issues or have suggestions/requests for the app (as opposed to appear.inâ€™s website), please **do not bother the appear.in team directly** but instead [open an issue](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/appear.in/issues/new).

## Install

[Download the latest version](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/appear.in/releases), or run `brew cask install appearin` if you use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

## Development

Built with [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

##### Commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run: `npm start`
- Build for macOS: `npm run build-macos`
- Build for all platforms: `npm run build`
- Build for macOS and package as a zip: `npm run package-macos`
- Build for all platforms and package as a zip: `npm run package`

Currently, only macOS is supported. I do not intend to officially support other platforms in the near future since I cannot consistently and reliably test on them, but am willing to add support if someone wants to collaborate in doing the legwork.
